# freeCodeCamp Certification Paths

A series of lessons and projects to earn certificates using freeCodeCamp.

## Scientific Computing with Python(Beta)

Learning Python creating algorithms and applications.

### Lessons

#### Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher

In this lesson, I learned fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

#### Learn How to Work with Numbers and Strings by Implementing the Luhn Algorithm

In this lesson, I gained experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.

#### Learn Lambda Functions by Building an Expense Tracker

In this lesson, I gained experience working with lambda functions by building an
expense tracker. I was also introduced to: `sum()`, `filter()`, lists and dictionaries.

#### Learn Python List Comprehension by Building a Case Converter

In this lesson, I gained experience in understanding how List Commprehension constructs a new Python list from an iterable type without using a loop or the `.append()` method.

A program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

Two phases: 1. Use a loop to implement the program. 2. Use List Comprehension instead of a loop to acheive the same results.

#### Learn Regular Expression by Building a Password Generator

In this lesson, I learned how to import modules from the Python standard library. I also learned how to use Regular Expressions.

A function that takes 5 parameters, `length`, `nums`, `special_chars`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`, and returns a randomly generated password.

#### Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algortithm

In this lesson, I gained experience building an algorithm using functions, loops, conditional statements and dictionary comprehension.

I saw an opportunty to refactor in the second file. Used ChatGPT as my Senior Python Developer to guide me. It told me the How and Why of the refactoring opportunities, without explicitly telling me where the refactors are. This allowed me to figure it out on my own and understand why it is important to do this.

In `line 26` we removed the if-else statement. I learned that we don't need to conditional. It adds an extra step in getting to `paths[node]` - a copy of `paths[current]`.
